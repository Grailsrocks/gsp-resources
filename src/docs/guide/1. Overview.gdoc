This plugin allows you to reference GSP-generated files as cacheable static resources.
Consider the following:

h3. fibonacci.js.gsp
{code}
<% fib = {n ->; return n <= 1 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)} %>
var fibonacci = [<%= (0..10).collect{ fib.call(it) }.join(',') %>];
{code}

This is then cacheable and serveable as a javascript file as:

{code}
var fibonacci = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55];
{code}
