In your project resources file, define GSPs as resources like any other resource type:

{code}
'style' {
    resource url:'css/test.css.gsp', attrs:[rel: 'stylesheet/css', type:'css']
}
{code}

Note the additional @attrs@ parameter, which is used to tell
the resources plugin the type of the resource being generated.
